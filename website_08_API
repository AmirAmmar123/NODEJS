Server REST API:
GET/ POST / PUT/ DELETE 
Return Data JSON Not HTML
why?
- HTML IS HEAVY (many of the information is not related to the DATA (TAGS, DEV, FORMS,...etc))
- HTML IS FROM OTHER LOCATION
- CLIENT is (ANDROID / SERVER) not using HTML  
-------------------------------------
Client:
calls the server 

HTML/DESKTOP/MOBILE => all those devices can send request to the server API


once i call GET i want to read all the details from the API
